TIPS FOR SUCCESS

• After each project:
  - Write down the time complexity of your core algorithm.
  - Refactor code for clarity and speed.
  - Try to explain your approach to someone else (or in comments).

• Use online judges for challenge problems:
  - LeetCode (practice structured problems)
  - HackerRank / Codewars (algorithm drills)
  - Project Euler (math-based algorithm problems)

• Recommended Resources:
  - “Grokking Algorithms” by Aditya Bhargava
  - “Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python” (online free)
  - YouTube: Computerphile / CS50 lectures for theory context
